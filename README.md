# Clickbait-Detection

Many online news media outlets rely largely on reader clicks for money, and they must compete for readership due to the existence of various media outlets. To entice viewers to click on an article and then visit the website, news reports include appealing titles after the article links, which encourage readers to click on the post. These types of tales are known as clickbait. Although such bait can entice readers to click, in the long term, clickbait rarely lives up to readers' expectations, leaving them dissatisfied.  It is therefore critical to classify stories as clickbait or non-clickbait and to warn viewers of various media outlets of the risk of baited headlines
